## Description 🧠 {#description}

### 1. **Smart Trash Bin Design & Construction** 🏗️
- Engineered compact and versatile smart trash bins suitable for various public environments including schools, parks, residential areas, and commercial zones.
- Incorporated multiple compartments within each bin to effectively segregate different waste types such as paper, plastic, and metal.

### 2. **Integrated Camera & Image Processing System** 📸
- Equipped each bin with an internal camera to capture images of deposited waste.
- Transmitted images to a centralized server for real-time processing and analysis.

### 3. **AI-Powered Waste Classification** 🤖
- Deployed advanced AI models to analyze images received from ESP32 cameras.
- Automated waste classification to streamline waste management processes and enhance operational efficiency.

### 4. **Automated Compartment Rotation Mechanism** 🔄
- Implemented a mechanical system that rotates compartments based on the waste type identified by the AI model.
- Ensured accurate segregation to facilitate efficient waste collection and recycling.

### 5. **Centralized Management & Monitoring** 📊
- Utilized a robust server system to manage and monitor the status of each trash bin in real-time.
- Provided an intuitive interface for administrators to track fill levels, optimize collection routes, and respond promptly to capacity issues.
